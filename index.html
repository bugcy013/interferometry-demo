<h1>Introduction to Interferometery and Synthesis Imaging</h1>

<p><span>â’¸</span> Lincoln Greenhill and Danny Price, 2015</p>
<p>Sythesis imaging is a method to combine the outputs of multiple radio antennas into a single image, boosting angular resolution and overall sensitivity. It depends upon the outputs of antennas being <em>interfered</em> together in pairs, measuring the amplitude and phase of the interfered signal. The output of each interfered pair gives information about the sky, which can be aggregated to form an image of the sky.</p>
<p>This notebook gives a quick interactive introduction to radio interferometers and synthesis imaging.</p>

<h1>A simple interferometer</h1>

<p>A radio interferometer computes pair-wise correlations between antennas. For an array of <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(N_ant\)</span> antennas, the number of possible pairs of antennas is given by</p>
<p><span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\( N<em>{pairs} = \frac{(N</em>{ant})(N_{ant} - 1)}{2}.\)</span></p>
<p>To give a simple example, imagine an array of three simple isotropic antennas (i.e. uniform sensitivity), arranged in a line with equal spacing <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(b\)</span> between antennas:</p>
<p><img src="public/images/interferometer.png"></p>
<p><strong>Fig 1:</strong> Geometry of an elementary three-element interfometer. Three antennas (elements) are arranged in a line with a spacing <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(b\)</span> between them.</p>
<p>If we connect the voltage outputs of the antennas to a device that cross-multiplies pairs of voltage streams <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(V_aV_b^<em>\)</em></span>, then we have a simple three-element interferometer, as shown in Fig 1. here, \ denotes complex conjugation. Such a device is known as a <em>correlator</em>.</p>
<p>Now, consider a single source at a sufficient distance to that the incident wavefront can be considered a plane wave. For now, let's consider the sources radiation to be given by</p>
<p><span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(e(t) = sin(2\pi\nu t)\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(\nu\)</span> represents frequency and <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(t\)</span> represents time. The radiation will reach the right-hand antenna before the left-hand antenna by a time equal to</p>
<p><span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(\tau_g = \frac{2b sin\theta}{c},\)</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(c\)</span> is the speed of light, and <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(\theta\)</span> is the angle of incidence. Given this, the output of the middle cross-multiplier in the diagram is:</p>
<p><span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(F = sin(2\pi\nu t)sin2\pi\nu(t - \tau_g),\)</span></p>
<p>for which time average of which can be shown to be <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(<f> = cos2\pi\nu t_g\)</f></span>. This is known as the <em>fringe frequency</em>, and can be considered the fundamental measurement from which interferometric synthesis images are created.</p>
<section data-type="sect2">
<h2>Fringe frequency</h2>

<p>The "fringe function" <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(F\)</span> is given by Eq. 2.2 in your textbook:</p>
<p><span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(F = cos2\pi\nu\tau_g=cos(\frac{2\pi b l}{\pi})\)</span></p>
<p>Where <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(l=sin(\theta)\)</span>. Here, <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(\theta\)</span> is the "pointing angle" of the telescope.</p>
<p>As the point source transits across the sky, the value of <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(\theta\)</span> changes and the fringe function will respond accordingly:</p>
<pre data-code-language="python" data-executable="true" data-type="programlisting">
def plot_fringe(bl_length, wavelength):
    """ Plot the fringe function for a baseline (see Fig 1)

    bl_length:      distance between antennas, in m
    wavelength:     wavelength, in m
    """
    theta = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 401)
    l = sin(theta)
    F = cos(2 * pi * bl_length * l / wavelength)
    F2 = cos(2 * pi * 2 * bl_length * l / wavelength)

    plt.plot(l, F, c='#cc0000', label="Baseline 1-2")
    plt.plot(l, F2, c='#0000cc', label="Baseline 1-3")
    plt.xlabel("$sin(\\theta)$")
    plt.ylabel("Fringe amplitude")
    plt.ylim(-2, 2)
    plt.legend()

f = interact(plot_fringe, bl_length=(1, 100), wavelength=(1, 100))
</pre>

<p>We see that as baseline increases, the fringe function oscillates more rapidly.</p>
</section>
<section data-type="sect2">
<h2>Multiple sources</h2>

<p>Things get more complicated when there is more than a single point source in the sky. Image that our point source has an companion a distance of <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(\theta_{spc}\)</span> away. What would then output of the correlator look like?</p>

    theta = np.linspace(-np.pi, np.pi, 401)

    # first baseline
    F_src1_bl1 = cos(2 * pi * bl_length * l / wavelength)
    F_src2_bl1 = cos(2 * pi * bl_length * (l - l_spc) / wavelength)

<p>Have a play around with the source spacing and you'll see that some source spacings result in absolutely no response (i.e. fringe amplitude is uniformly zero, no matter what the position <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(\theta\)</span> of the first source is).</p>
<p>By now I hope you're convinced that the output of the correlator is telling you a lot of information about the composition of the sky. But how do we turn these data into images? To answer that will require a bit more reading of your textbook and a bunch of math. So you'll have to wait until the next notebook!</p>

<h1>Aside: correlator computations</h1>

<p>Cross-correlation of every sample at <a href="http://www.dspguide.com/ch3/2.htm">Nyquist rate</a> for every antenna pair can be very computationally expensive. Pairwise correlation of all antennas is an <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(O(N^2)\)</span> operation, meaning that as the number of antennas <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(N\)</span> increases, the number of computations required increases in proportion to <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(N^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>More precisely, the number of possible pairs of antennas (counting pairing with themselves) is given by</p>
<p><span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\( N<em>{pairs} = \frac{(N</em>{ant})(N_{ant} + 1)}{2}.\)</span></p>
<p>The number of computation operations required per second (measured in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOPS">FLOP/s</a>) also depends upon the bandwidth of the digitized signals. Radio arrays tend to have signal bandwidths <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(\Delta\nu\)</span>  in the range 10 MHz - 10 GHz; digitization requires sampling at a rate <span class="math-tex" data-type="tex">\(2\Delta\nu\)</span>.</p>
<p>The widget below computes the number of FLOP/s a correlator would need for a given bandwidth and number of antennas. A rough estimate of how many graphics processing units (GPUs) would be required if they are used to do the computation is also given, along with how much they'd cost to purchase (you would need host systems for them as well!)</p>
